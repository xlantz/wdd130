            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm from Culpeper, Virginia, USA.
            I'm studying software development, which has been
            enjoyable so far.
            I like to hike, learn new languages, read, and much more. I know over five
            langauges. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have studied abroad in Germany and Switzerland. I love to travel and I have been doing it my whole life.
            I am married with two children. My currenty job is 
            an operations coordinator. I wish to make more money 
            so that is why I am pursuing a BS in software development. What I love 
            most about BYU-I is how cheap it is; I can continue living
            debt-free. The advantages I see from learning web design
            are the fact that this is a great starting point to learn 
            programming and that I just get to learn something new.
        </p>

            I have been a member of the church for nearly 20 years.
            I do not have a favorite quote, nor do I have a favorite 
            scripture. I like the lessons that I learn, which can be 
            applied to my life in order to better myself and then help 
            others.
